# ITI Database Exercises Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to the database exercises from the Information Technology Institute (ITI) course. The solutions include database diagrams, schemas, and related documentation.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into multiple directories (d1-d9), each containing solutions to different sets of exercises:

```
├── d1/
│   ├── Q1.png
│   ├── Q2.drawio
│   └── Q3.png
├── d2/
│   ├── Q1.png
│   ├── Q2.drawio
│   └── Q3.png
└── ... (d3-d9)
```

## Contents

Each directory contains:
- PNG files showing database diagrams and solutions
- DrawIO files for editable database diagrams
- Solutions to various database design problems and exercises

## Tools Used

- Draw.io / Diagrams.net for creating database diagrams

## How to Use

1. Browse through the directories (d1-d9) to find specific exercise solutions
2. Open .png files to view the diagrams directly
